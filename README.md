# Numerical-Methods

Repository for projects from Numerical-Methods Lab.

This repository consists of projects from 3 courses which I had at Silesian University of Technology. Has 3 branches each for 1 course.
  1. Numerical methods - Metody numeryczne (NM).
  2. Numerical methods in technique - Metody numeryczne w technice (NMT).
  3. Selected methods of mathematical modeling - Wybrane metody modelowania matematycznego (SMMM).   
  
Most projects are written using Software Mathematica-Wolfram.   
Comments in a code and variables can be written in Polish Language.
